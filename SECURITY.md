# 🔒 Security Guidelines for MyDoctorApp

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in MyDoctorApp and provides guidelines for secure deployment and usage.

> **Important**: This is a portfolio/demonstration project. For production medical applications, additional security measures, compliance certifications (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.), and security audits would be required.

## 🛡️ Implemented Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Bearer Tokens**: Secure API authentication
- **Token Expiration**: Configurable token lifetime
- **Role-based Access**: Foundation for role-based authorization
- **Password Hashing**: Secure password storage (see `PasswordService`)

### Data Protection
- **Input Validation**: FluentValidation for all user inputs
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Entity Framework Core parameterized queries
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks
- **CORS Configuration**: Controlled cross-origin access

### Infrastructure Security
- **Non-root Docker User**: Containers run with limited privileges
- **Environment Variables**: Secrets not hardcoded in application
- **Health Checks**: Monitoring for security and availability
- **Structured Logging**: Audit trails for security monitoring

## 🚨 Security Warnings

### Development vs Production
The included configuration files contain **EXAMPLE VALUES ONLY**:

**❌ DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION:**
- `DevJwtKeyForLocalDevelopmentOnly32Chars!` (Development JWT key)
- `dev_password_change_me` (Development database password)
- Any hardcoded credentials in Docker files

**✅ PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS:**
- Generate cryptographically secure random keys
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Implement proper secret management
- Enable HTTPS/TLS
- Regular security updates

## 🔐 Secure Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] **Generate secure JWT key** (minimum 32 characters, cryptographically random)
- [ ] **Create strong database passwords** (minimum 12 characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- [ ] **Review and update CORS policies** for your domain
- [ ] **Configure HTTPS/TLS certificates**
- [ ] **Set up proper logging and monitoring**
- [ ] **Implement backup strategies**

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Example secure configuration (generate your own values!)
Jwt__Key="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection="Host=secure-host;Database=MyDoctorDb;Username=appuser;Password=$(pwgen -s 16 1);SslMode=Require"
```

### Database Security
- [ ] **Create dedicated database user** (not postgres superuser)
- [ ] **Enable SSL/TLS for database connections**
- [ ] **Configure firewall rules** (restrict database access)
- [ ] **Regular database backups** with encryption
- [ ] **Database audit logging**

### Application Security
- [ ] **Enable HTTPS redirect** in production
- [ ] **Configure security headers** (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
- [ ] **Set up API rate limiting** appropriate for your usage
- [ ] **Implement proper error handling** (don't expose internal details)
- [ ] **Regular security updates** for dependencies

## 🏥 Healthcare-Specific Considerations

> **Disclaimer**: This portfolio project is not intended for actual medical use without proper compliance certifications.

For production medical applications, consider:

### Compliance Requirements
- **HIPAA** (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) - US
- **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation) - EU
- **HITECH** (Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health) - US
- **Local healthcare regulations** in your jurisdiction

### Additional Security Measures
- **End-to-end encryption** for sensitive medical data
- **Data anonymization** capabilities
- **Audit logging** for all data access
- **Access controls** with principle of least privilege
- **Data retention policies**
- **Incident response procedures**
- **Regular security assessments**

## 📋 Security Best Practices

### Development
1. **Never commit secrets** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for configuration
3. **Regular dependency updates** (`dotnet list package --outdated`)
4. **Static code analysis** tools
5. **Security testing** in CI/CD pipeline

### Production
1. **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**
2. **DDoS protection**
3. **Regular security scans**
4. **Penetration testing**
5. **Security monitoring and alerting**
6. **Incident response plan**

### Operational
1. **Regular backups** with encryption
2. **Disaster recovery procedures**
3. **Staff security training**
4. **Access review processes**
5. **Security policy documentation**

## 🚨 Incident Response

### Security Incident Types
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Data breaches
- System compromises
- Denial of service attacks

### Response Steps
1. **Immediate containment**
2. **Assess the scope**
3. **Notify stakeholders**
4. **Document the incident**
5. **Implement fixes**
6. **Post-incident review**

## 📞 Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **Email** security concerns to: [your-email@domain.com]
3. **Include** detailed information about the vulnerability
4. **Allow time** for investigation and fix before public disclosure
